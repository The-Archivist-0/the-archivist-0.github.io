You want to know why this is here?</p>
<p>Well, let's think about this. Why don't we start with you?</p>
<p>I know who you are.</p>
<p>That sounds a little bit strange, doesn't it? After all, this is just an archive of someone's personal diary. How could I change this message to reflect your life? Truth be told, I can't; but I think I can do a little bit better than that.</p>
<p>If you're here, then you must have heard that this exists. Someone told you. And you, you were curious enough to find out what this was. Indeed, you even found my little commentary.</p>
<p>Therefore... you care about them, don't you? You know what's happened to them, and you want to know how to help them. You want to know how I come into play. What I did to them.</p>
<p>But you can't do anything. You know this information, but do the artificer's friends know it as well?</p>
<p>So, lets go back to my original point.</p>
<p>I know who you are.</p>
<p>You are <strong>pathetic</strong>.</p>
<p>Run along back <a href="/">home</a>, children. It's too late for you to grow up.</p>

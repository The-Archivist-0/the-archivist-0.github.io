<p>Not quite sure what prompted me to start this. Maybe it's because I finished the newest <em>Alchemists of Ryverna</em> book (btw I might do a book review on it)? Either way, here's what I did.</p>
<p>First of, let me just say - I don't understand alchemy. I genuinely don't. I can sort of do it??? But it doesn't really work out that well.</p>
<p>I tried to make one of those random elixirs. As in, you drink it, it does something random to you, but overall it's a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Do you think that these hands can do that? These six-fingered, chaotic hands? With my arson brain?</p>
<p>HAHAHA.</p>
<p>The house almost caught on fire.</p>
<p>Don't do this at home.</p>

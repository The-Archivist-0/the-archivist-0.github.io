<p>Alex is going out to uni again. He says he'll be gone for about two weeks.</p>
<p>He's not gone yet, but I already miss him, and not in some sort of sweet, nostalgic way. I feel like I shouldn't be complaining. I've got Emily, Lucy and Alex Jr with me, shouldn't they be enough? They love me, and I love them back. So why do I still feel lonely when he's gone?</p>
<p><s>fucking hell i know why i hate this i hate this why cant i just be normal why cant i just forget its been so long since it all happened</s></p>

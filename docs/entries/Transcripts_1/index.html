<p>I've started deciphering the book. The pages are incredibly old, so I've had to be extra careful as to not tear them. I am also logging the plaintext inside of my journal for quick reference - thankfully it translates to just Common.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>A Study in Death</h2>
<p>To say that death is inevitable is an understatement. You cannot possibly understand the magnitude of your death. It's not merely about your body and your mind, but your legacy. Those who remember you will eventually pass on and the words that they decided to share will become twisted at the hands of time. It is then in these false <em>remnants</em> that you truly die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this even mean? Who wrote this? Why do they care about death so much?</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>A Study in Companionship</h2>
<p>'Friends' has never been a term that has felt right with me. It feels incredibly... informal. &quot;These are my 'friends'&quot; - and? You have told me nothing about these people. All I now know is that you've created an emotion-fuelled death wish for yourself. In the day that you heroically sacrifice your life to save them, are you really saving them? Or is the mental damage you inflict on them justified by society?</p>
<p>For this reason, I prefer the word 'aquaintances'. Whilst I do tend to introduce my allies individually, 'aquaintances' provides a sense of anonmyous comfort for me and a logical distance away from sentimental impulses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one is a bit weird. I can't tell if I'm judging the author, or if I feel bad that they can't connect with people.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>A Study in Study</h2>
<p>Research is at the core of any thinker. You cannot properly begin to comment on your chosen subject without first knowing the ins and outs of it - you must know the rules before you break them, as they say.</p>
<p>Always be sure to use a wide variety of sources in your research, and try to get first hand experience yourself. Being able to witness things first hand has shaped the course of my life and how I apply myself to my studies.</p>
<p>One more point: record your findings. Forgetfulness in scholars is far too common for my liking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose I can get behind this one, it makes sense.</p>
<hr>
<p>All of these pages are just strange. Why would you encrypt this? It wasn't even that difficult to figure out. Then again, I'm not really showing my journal to anyone...</p>

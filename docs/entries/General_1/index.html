<p>Eyyy guess what! Another <em>Alchemists of Ryverna</em> book came out! Alex has been super stoked for it. The only real reason I'm excited is because he's excited tbh. I never normally see him this, to use his own words, 'unprofessional'. I do sorta wonder how good it is though. He keeps going on about this one mad scientist guy who is a part of this guild and about the ending of the last book that involved him? Honestly, I'm confused. I've got some free time on Saturday, so maybe I'll borrow the first book off of him.</p>

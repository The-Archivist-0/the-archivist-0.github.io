<p>I went back to the library today to return the book I borrowed, and... that old book is <em>still</em> there. No one has even touched it since I last was there. I guess the staff was getting the same weird vibes as I was.</p>
<p>I decided to have another look at it before anyone could see me. The pages are most likely encrypted, as I don't recgonise the language nor the script.</p>
<p>I'm going to bring it home. Maybe it'll have something useful inside. Either way, I'll work on it after I complete my next invention.</p>

<p>Whenever Alex goes away, we tend to communicate via sending stone. However, sending stones only allow you to use them once per day due to the latent magic within them not being particularly strong. The solution? Give them more magic!</p>
<p>The first version of the sending stones works as intended, however has a chance to explode (thankfully it did not explode whilst Alex was at uni, but now I have to replace my tea bags).</p>
<p>I'm thinking that I may have put too much evocation magic into the stone and turned it into a small fireball. It did also begin to heat up with overuse, so that probably didn't help.</p>
<p>I might have to recreate a sending stone from scratch so I can add in a custom cooling system.</p>
<p>On another note, if anyone wants to make this, just cast <em>sending</em> at a pair of sending stones three times. Again, just be aware of the chance that it could explode due to overuse.</p>

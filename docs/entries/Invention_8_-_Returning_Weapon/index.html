<p>Sometimes I feel like I should be doing my artificer-y things. Y'know, so maybe when I get out there, I'll look more of the part. Apparently this is a somewhat common project for beginners, but I think that I'll try to... put my own spin on it?</p>
<p>The way this one works is that you're meant to enchant the handle of the weapon to recognise that it was thrown to begin with and where to return to. A secondary enchantment also goes on the blade, axehead, etc, to indicate a hit - this emits a signal back to the handle to return.</p>
<p>I decided to enchant a handaxe that was lying around the house (don't judge me). It's a little bit finicky and difficult to explain, but I recommened carving the glyphs into the material if you can.</p>
<p>It does work as expected! Just don't try to chop down a tree with it.</p>

<p>Had a weird day today. I decided to go out to the library with Alex, and I ended up finding some old book. Asked some staff about it, but they didn't even remember having it. I decided to put it back. That's like, textbook 'spooky stuff is about to happen to you'. Then again, maybe I should have gotten rid of it in case some other person takes it out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Why do I feel like I'm overthinking this? This is one of the dumbest things I've gotten worked up about.</p>

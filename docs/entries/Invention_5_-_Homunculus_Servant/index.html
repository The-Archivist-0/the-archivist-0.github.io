<p>I've always wanted to have my own little servant. I've seen them before, and they are just the most adorable little dudes. So smol and so tiny. I want to give all of a them a pat on the head.</p>
<p>So now I have my own that I can pat on the head.</p>
<p>Alex gave me a gem as a birthday present. So, I made Alex Jr. He's a little potion bottle with wings!!! Alex says that he finds him annoying, but I know for certain that he finds him adorable. I mean, who wouldn't love a bottle that flaps around excitedly whenever you compliment him and can SHOOT LASERS. DID I MENTION THAT HE CAN SHOOT LASERS, BECAUSE HE CAN SHOOT LASERS.</p>
<p>Sorry this entry isn't as helpful or documenting (?) as my other ones. I got a new friend and dammit I want to talk about him!!</p>

<p>When I was eight, I created my first spellwrought tattoo and summoned my familiar, Lucy, for the first time. I remember the excitement I felt at being able to hold her in my arms, give her pets, give her treats, and give her a name. She's with me now even as I'm writing this (and trying to dip her paws in the ink -_-).</p>
<p>Ever since that day, I wanted to share the exciement I felt with others. So, I've been working on a dedicated spell scroll for summoning familiars.</p>
<p>Whilst many spell scrolls and spellwrought tattos exist for this sort of thing, mine has a few changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scroll is only used for summoning a familiar.</li>
<li>The time taken for the spell to work is reduced.</li>
<li>The materials needed to create the spell scroll have been reduced.</li>
<li>The scroll itself is physcially smaller and more portable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still working on a couple of details, but so far I've been able to successfully resummon Lucy! Hopefully I'll be able to publish the instructions for how to make your own soon.</p>

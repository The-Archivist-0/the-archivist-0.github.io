<p>Alex came back today!! He says he's almost finished with his MD! I'm super happy for him, he's been working really hard the past few months.</p>
<p>I might not be able to write many more entries in the next coming months, as I'm going to be busy helping out in town - Alex wants me to try and work part-time somewhere. I'm a little bit nervous about screwing it up. I've never done anything like that before, and I'm worried that I just won't be able to do what they want me to do. I've worked with Alex on small projects before, but I don't know how I'll react around more people.</p>
<p>Sorry for rambling, it's been a long day.</p>

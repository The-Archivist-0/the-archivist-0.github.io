<p>So I decided to look more into flamethrowers and found out about a branch of artificers that can magically produce ones out of thin air??? I AM LOVING THIS SO MUCH.</p>
<p>To get one set up is a little bit complicated. You need to make the base model - this model will need to be able to support the various forms that an Eldritch Cannon can take. Don't worry about any sort of fuel - it is magically provided when you create the cannon.</p>
<p>I went outside to have a proper test run of my cannon, who I have named CRISPY. I don't think CRISPY is sentient, but if they are, I hope they like their name.</p>
<p>The first test didn't work as well as I hoped, but DID YOU KNOW THEY CAN HAVE LEGS??? THEY CAN MOVE.</p>
<p>LET ME REPEAT THIS.</p>
<p>THE FLAMETHROWER. CAN. WALK.</p>
<p>I love them :D</p>

<p>I will now do what all great inventors must do.</p>
<p>This next invention will guarntee you can teleport to the nearest library (or building that holds over 100 books). In order to reproduce this yourself, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fancy marker of some kind to draw on the ground (chalk, ink, etc). The materials will need to cost about 1gp for this to work, so it's a bit expensive.</li>
<li>Candles</li>
<li>An empty space of about 5ft x 5ft</li>
<li>A book you are willing to sacrifice :(</li>
<li><s>THE SACRIFICAL BLADE</s> You do not need this I was just angry</li>
</ul>
<p>First, draw a circle using your marker. This circle be about 5ft in diameter, and must contain the following glyphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book</li>
<li>Tear</li>
<li>Circle</li>
<li>Ruin</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, place your candles around the edges of the circle and light them - the amount doesn't matter.</p>
<p>After that, place a book in the centre of the circle. This book must contain printed text. You must then destroy the book in any way you deem fit, but do not let its remains outside of the circle.</p>
<p>By doing this, you have now created a magical anomly that will teleport you to the nearest location that has at least 100 books. This is most likely incredibly dangerous, but I do not care &gt;:P</p>

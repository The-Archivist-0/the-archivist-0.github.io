<p>I know I'm not the first person to make a steel defender, but dammit I want to talk about Emily.</p>
<p>Making my first steel defender was a big undertaking. I had no idea what I was doing, I just had the materials and started building. I never really knew that you were bonded to them - I swear as I've gotten older Emily has too, and not just in the sense that 'stuff ages and wears down'. In this way, defenders are inherently magical, as are most artificer things.</p>
<p>Speaking of artificers, for anyone else who has their own defender, how do they act? It's just that when I imagined 'defender' when I was younger I thought of some sort of guard dog. Y'know, protect you with your life, that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with Emily (I will fight you if you say that &gt;:/), but she's just WAY more cuddly than I expected. That's not a bad thing, I like a nice hug.</p>
<p>There's probably a reason for this. Could comfort be a different form of protection to her?</p>

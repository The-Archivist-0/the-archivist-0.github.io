<p>I went out to go and buy some food today, and I heard some people talking. Well, when I say that, of course people were talking, but just... not in the good way.</p>
<p>Something serious is going on up north. Apparently someone has managed to amass a small army and is threatening the local baronies. The part that makes me nervous is that we're only just hearing about this. Who knows what's already happened?</p>
<p>I've sent out a message to Alex. He says that his graduation is in a few days, and then he'll be hurrying home. I feel like I should be doing something, something else. What if they reach home?</p>

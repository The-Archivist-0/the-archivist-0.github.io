<p>This is pure spite contained within the form of a simple dog whistle.</p>
<p>Now, as you know, werewolves transform into wolf-men hybrids under a full moon.</p>
<p>But did you also know that some wolfish traits also carry on over into their original form?</p>
<p>I think you can see where this is going.</p>
<p>The Extraplanar Dog Whistle can be summoned through a flick of the wrist and the motivation to annoy someone close to you, like any good sibling. It then functions like a regular dog whistle, until you flick your wrist to store it again (do note that for this step you will need sufficent energy, lest you chuck the whistle across the room).</p>
<p>If you want to create your own, you'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dog whistle</li>
<li>The ability to cast <em>wristpocket</em> (you may need to ask around for a dunamancy wizard)</li>
<li>The essence of corrupted metamagic (it sounds difficult, but get a book about metamagic, and try to replicate the steps - you'll soon mess it up because you don't know what you're doing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Infuse the dog whistle with the metamagic, and then cast <em>wristpocket</em>. The dog whistle will then require you to attune to it, but after that, it should work!</p>

<p>So, I got fired. Didn't expect that, but it's alright. I'm doing fine.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a new thing I made that I was going to use.</p>
<p>The auto-stamper detects boxes on the bottom half of paper and stamps it. It doesn't work too great, still needs some improvements (namely an 'off' button), but it does the job if you keep most sheets of paper 5ft away from it at all times.</p>
<p>This one isn't really one of my favourties.</p>

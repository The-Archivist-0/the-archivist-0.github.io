<p>I have a feeling this was long overdue, but I have finally managed to put together my thoughts on the newest <em>Alchemists of Ryverna</em> book. This one is called <em>Tales from the Summit</em>, and it picks up on Seraph's journey to reclaim the Five Talismans from the Ashborn Syndicate.</p>
<p>First of, apparently a lot of people don't like this one for some reason? I think it's because the author decided to use a more epistolary format. I don't really mind it - it's a bit jarring from the last novels, but I think it really emphasises how Seraph has pushed everyone away in her quest to 'be the hero' and keep them safe.</p>
<p>Another thing I liked was the Syndicate boss. Without giving away too many spoilers, I love the plot twist surrounding them. It's honestly so cool to realise exactly what was going on with them the whole time, and why they were acting so weird! The twist is still good even if you reread it, because the signs become SO OBVIOUS. GAH. MY HEART.</p>
<p>Honestly, the only thing I don't like about this book is the cover. The colour scheme is awful - green and purple? Really? I mean, sometimes it can look nice, but the shades the artist clash so much. The portrait of Seraph is alright, but the Talismans just make everything feel too cluttered, y'know?</p>
<p>Overall, I will give <em>Alchemists of Ryverna: Tales from the Summit</em>...</p>
<p>8 out of 10!</p>
<p>Great book and a great story, can't wait for the next one!</p>
